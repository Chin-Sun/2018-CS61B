# 2018-CS61B

Before taking 61B class, I take 61A first which includes more basic knowledge about computer science. Since I never took any course of computer science systematically, I don't know  necessary rules forced to followe when writing code. I spent 4 days finishing watching 61A's videos. Actually, it turns out that 61A class is very useful for code amateur who plan to work on the field of computer science.

The repository serves as the database of storing 61B' course assignments finished by myself.

I plan to finish 61B course for 2 weeks.
