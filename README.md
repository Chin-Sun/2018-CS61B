**Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structure and their relationships.**
Improve â†‘ this one by solving problems on Leedcode and learning good solutions about every problem on Youtube or that web.

Before taking 61B class, I take 61A first which includes more basic knowledge about computer science. Since I never took any course of computer science systematically, I don't know  necessary rules forced to followe when writing code for algorithm. I spent 4 days finishing watching 61A's videos. Actually, it turns out that 61A class is very useful for code amateur who plan to work on the field of computer science.  

Next I plan to finish 61B course for 2 weeks.

The repository serves as the database of storing 61B' course assignments finished by myself.
