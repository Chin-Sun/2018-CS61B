1. Functions--basic
2. Control------------
	Print and None;
	Miscellaneous Python Features; 
	Conditional Statement;
	Iteration;
	Return;
	Designing Functions;
3. Higher-Order Functions-------
	Higher-Order Functions: General patterns with assignments and computational process；
	Return a functions as Return Values: Locally Defined function；
	One example;
	Function Composition: compose two or more functions into one expression to achieve them
        Function Currying: multiple-functions--->one single higher-function
	Abstraction: The rule of name function and value -->easily understand;
			f,g,h - Function
			x,y,z - Real number
			n,k,i - Integers

4. Environment Diagram--------
	Multiple Environments: how multiple functions work in one environments;
	Environments for Higher-Order Functions: how it works
        One example↑
