3. Higher-Order Functions-------
	Higher-Order Functions: General patterns with assignments and computational processï¼›
	Return a functions as Return Values: Locally Defined functionï¼›
	One example;
	Function Composition: compose two or more functions into one expression to achieve them
        Function Currying: multiple-functions--->one single higher-function
	Abstraction: The rule of name function and value -->easily understand
