# Week 1 + Week 2
**Efficient & Saving Space**
****
1. {  } & ；用来分割  
2. varaibles must be declared, such as int, string....  
3. functions (methods) are declared as a part of class

public class Printstrings{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    string x='*';
    int i=0;

    if (i<5){
      System.out.println("x");
      x=x+*;

### Golden Rule of Equals
There are 9 types of variables in Java  
- 8 primitive types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char)
- The 9th type is references to Objects (an arrow). References may be null.

In box-and-pointer notation, each variable is drawn as a labeled box and values are shown in the box.  
- Addresses are represented by arrows to object instances.

#### Given variables b and a:  
b = a copies all the bits from a into b 　　

#### Parameter Passing:  
This is also called **pass by value**:  Passing Parameters obeys the same rule: Simply **copy the bits** to the new scope.  

----------------------
#### What is Recursion?
- base case: stop condition
- recursion condition.
